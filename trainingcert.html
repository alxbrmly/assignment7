				<p>2014 was a great year for SPAN â€“ and we owe a great debt of thanks to the many volunteers who helped during this past year. </p>

<p>We were successful completing an extremely ambitious slate of projects. Volunteers contributed more than 2,800 hours of service this year and played a big role in our success.</p>

<p>We rescued 1,478 plants in 2015! A huge accomplishment for all! And one of the most impressive volunteer accomplishments in 2015 was our trip to Colombia, where we saved three corn fields from being plowed under by local militia. Kudos to all who survived the trip!</p>

<p>Volunteer efforts really do make a difference. SPAN would like to extend its sincere thanks for the help we have received this year. We invite everyone to continue their support in the future and we look forward to involving many new volunteers in our projects and events.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>



<h2>Upcoming Events:</h2>

<p>Please join us for our protest at the Field of Dreams cornfield in Dyersville, Iowa on November 12th. Fields should not be photographed and then plowed under for a movie shot! What about CGI?!</p>
